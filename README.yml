        Nowadays, Speech Recognition is becoming more and more
        important. Many technology companies are trying to use Big
        Data to develop more efficient and accurate algorithm for
        Speech Recognition. Nowadays, Deep learning can be described
        as the foundation of Speech Recognition. Deep learning
        algorithms such as RNN and CNN often need to supported by
        large amount of data -- Big data.  Before Big Data and deep
        learning, the word error rate was 24 percent.  Recently, IBM
        published a paper where the word error rate was below 5.5
        percent.  In August, Microsoft speech recognition system has
        reached a 5.1 percent error rate.

        Face recognition is a technology focus on identity retrieval
        and verification.  Face recognition extracting face
        information from a given static or dynamic images to match
        with the known identity face database. Due to the interference
        of illumination, expression, occlusion and orientation, the
        accuracy of face recognition technology is relatively low
        compared with other recognition technology, such as palm print
        and fingerprint. But the acquisition method of Face
        recognition is the most friendly : without the cooperation of
        the parties, even in the case of its lack of awareness, it
        completed the acquisition and identification of face
        information. Therefore, face recognition technology has been a
        hot research topic in the field of artificial intelligence for
        more than 40 years and has gradually become mature.  Many
        technology companies are trying to use Big Data to develop
        more efficient and accurate algorithm for Face Recognition.
        It has been used in fields such as anti-terrorism, security
        and access control.  In recent years, it has been applied to
        fields such as education and finance Promotion.
