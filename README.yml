        Nowadays, Speech Recognition is becoming more and more
        important. Many technology companies are trying to use Big
        Data to develop more efficient and accurate algorithm for
        Speech Recognition. Nowadays, Deep learning can be described
        as the foundation of Speech Recognition. Deep learning
        algorithms such as RNN and CNN often need to supported by
        large amount of data -- Big data.  Before Big Data and deep
        learning, the word error rate was 24 percent.  Recently, IBM
        published a paper where the word error rate was below 5.5
        percent.  In August, Microsoft speech recognition system has
        reached a 5.1 percent error rate.
