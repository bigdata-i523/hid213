    title> Comparison between different classification algorithms in Digit Recognizer
    abstract: >
        Digit Recognizer is becoming more and more important in many different areas, such as zip code recognizer, banking receipt and balance sheet. Many technology companies are trying to use Big Data to develop more efficient and accurate algorithm for Digit Recognizer. This project uses Digit Recognizer data set from Kaggle.com. There are more than 42000 samples in the data set. Each sample contains 784 features which contain pixel information from a $28*28$ graph. Each pixel has a value between 0 to 255. We use binary classification technique for data cleaning and PCA for feature extraction. For the classification model, we choose five most commonly used classification algorithms, which include Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). From the result, SVM classifier on PCA data produces the highest accuracy with 0.9813. The time spend is 127 seconds. Naive Bayes classifier on PCA data spends the least amount of time to finish the classification task. It takes less one second and reaches a 0.8651 accuracy.
