   title: Big Data and Speech Recognition 
   abstract: >
       Nowadays, Speech Recognition is becoming more and more
       important. Many technology companies are trying to use Big Data
       to develop more efficient and accurate algorithm for Speech
       Recognition. Nowadays, Deep learning can be described as the
       foundation of Speech Recognition. Deep learning algorithms such
       as RNN and CNN often need to supported by large amount of data
       -- Big data.  Before Big Data and deep learning, the word error
       rate was 24 percent. Recently, IBM published a paper where the
       word error rate was below 5.5 percent. In August, Microsoft
       speech recognition system has reached a 5.1 percent error rate.

   title:  Big data and face identification
   abstract: >
       This paper is about how big data applied on face identification. A
       face recognition system is a computer application capable of
       identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video
       frame from a video source. One of the ways to do this is by
       comparing selected facial features from the image and a face
       database.
